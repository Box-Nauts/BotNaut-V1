LORE

In a really strange galaxy of the boxverse, made of stellar systems with purple and blue stars, a quite huge civilization was living peacefuly in one of the planets. There were on a purple planet, with huge blue rings around the planet. They were doing experiments, but one day, an experiment gone wrong. They were testing a new type of energy, made of condensed stellar energy. But this energy was too strong, and started to infect the population. The virus was very strong, and sadly, they need to flee their planet, and the stellar system, because of heavy loss. Time pass, and they decided to create a faction, and use lilas (color) and cyan to remember their planet, and dark to symbolize space.

============

MAIN GOAL

Our main goal is to gather lot of resources to become more and more powerful, and maybe one of the biggest faction. We will help as much as possible our members by giving them resources they need, or if they are under attack. We will try to be as peaceful as possible, but if an other faction prove to be mean, or stop us during our gathering, we will have to fight them.
We will also try to colonize lots of planets, and take advantage of their natural resources. We will be happy to trade with others factions as well.
One of our secondary goal is to legalize lolis in the entire universe, and another is to become the biggest french faction of all the universe, and to get the most powerful weapons.

WHY YOU NEED TO JOIN US

We are a friendly faction, with funny roles because we are french and french are fun. We will host events (maybe) in our discord, and in-game we will help you to progress (and vice versa). And even if you're not french, join us because we love everybody (i think). AND because we are big brain, we even got an interplanetar anthem ! So what are you waiting for ?
