The Clark Company

Lore:

[WIP]

In 1917, The Clark Company was credited with inventing the forklift, although the true creator’s name has been lost through time. This gasoline powered prototype device quickly caught on, and today, there are more than a million forklifts in use in warehouses across Earth. 

As the Forklift Faction, we wish to be a peaceful group. The Forklift Faction is a cargo, trading and, most importantly, a supplier group that doesn’t tend to battle, but we are skilled in the engineering department and the more technical side of things, although perhaps that means we could use our capabilities for warfare…

Why you should join:

I'm going to be honest, I don't know why you should join. We're just a friendly cargo group who have some plans but we don't want to be too big on war or as aggressive as others, but it would really help out if you did.

Colours:

Black and Purple (Don't worry, I checked with The Imperium)
