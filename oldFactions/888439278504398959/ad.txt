Lore:
Many many moons ago 4 clans lived together on a quaint planet know as Crashing Wave for years there had been small arguments and scuffles but they were all quickly and safely resolved , suddenly a massive war broke out between the 4 neighboring clans, the rulers had long been feuding over the lands shrinking resources which they had shared for centuries, with friends turned to foe the Tachibana Clan decided to fight back , with an army who was prepared and willing to die for their brethern their lives and the safety of the clan they fought relentlessly for days , weeks , and months. Finally as the dust had settled most if not all of the opposition had either been slain or had defected to the Tachibana clan but with food and recourses in the land still being scarce the clan now larger than ever quickly got back on its feet and created a New United Nomadic Clan whoâ€™s goal now was to search for new lands in order to maintain peace and unity within the Clan.

Purpose:
With the Tachibana Clan now larger than even in order to maintain the new found peace and prosperity the clan sets off from their home planet to find new land to conquer, because of the Tachibana Clan's size and expertise in combat most foes run in fear of their sheer size and combat prowess. Every member is willing to fight and risk their lives in order to protect their fellow man, and while most fear the Clan, they accept anyone who is looking for a home, a family and as long as they are willing to fight for and with the clan they will be accepted with open arms into the Tachibana Clan


Why You Should Join:
The members of the Tachibana Clan priorities the growth and safety of the overall clan in order to assure the prosperity we strive for, members should provide recourses to the clan and the clan will reciprocate as the goal is to support each other as we travel the galaxy and conquer the vast lands https://discord.gg/N3JZJebdZu
