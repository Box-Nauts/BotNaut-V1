Tomiun Church Lore


The Beginning

It is the galactic year 6515, a poor but good looking man has just purchased his first mining equipment. He has been working in the factories for ages just to afford this one set.

This man was the soon to be grand leader of the Church of Tomiun.

After descending in to the depth of the mines once more to be able to make a living, tomiun found himself wandering throughout the cave in search for valuable minerals when suddendly a massive worm appearerd in front of him. The scaly skin seemed indestructable and tomiun was about to run away when he noticed, that in fact the worm was not alive but  an ancient fossil.

Mining for hours, trying to get a better look at the fossil, he finally discovered the creatures head. To his surprise its teeth had been crystalized and turned into invaluable gems, but the biggest prize was yet to be discovered.

Succeeding his beautiful discovery he climbed into the creatures skull, when the jaw abruptly closed. It was a miracle that he was not chopped to pieces by the razorsharp jewels.
For a minute he was shocked to his core, what could have made the jaw close so swiflty? An earthquake seemed the most logical but the planet tomiun was currently stationed on was known for its geolocial calmness and before he could think to activate his built-in flashlight he got blinded by beautiful light, more colors than a rainbow, more colors than he should have been allowed to see.
But these colors were not just a picture, they were wisdom in its purest form.
Days later he was found by explorers that had accidentally mistook the fossil for a rare and unique rock type and had struck open the huge fossil with a drill.
Still blinded tomiun began to develop his teaching using nothing but the wisdom the mysterious light had given him. 
Out of his first few students soon grew a system wide conviction, that all the universe had to be taught what he had been taught so long ago.
