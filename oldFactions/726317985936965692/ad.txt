The Eternal Empire

"The Eternal Empire, also known colloquially as the Eternal Empire of Zakuul or the Zakuul empire, was a totalitarian dictatorship in the Outer Rim that was based on the Wild Space planet Zakuul. It was led by Emperor Revan sometime before the Galactic War that Revan sought to use to reshape the galaxy."

Our aspirations are to become the most dominant faction of the boxverse, rivalled by none and feared by all. We seek not only power, but knowledge and wealth to expand our great empire across the stars, hence, we are looking for able bodied men and women to fill our ranks and provide their services in our conquest of the galaxy. In return for your enlistment, you will be granted safety and protection, as well as weapons, equipment and perhaps even a high status within the empire if you are capable.

Join today to aid us in our conquest of the stars!
"The future is not a river to carry us. It is the ocean in which we drown, if we are not prepared.‚Äù
