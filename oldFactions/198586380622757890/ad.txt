```Welcome to The Drift League

[ Lore ]
The Drifters are a group of Boxnauts that hail from the once-great Citadel. The Citadel was considered a place of worship and allowed followers to possess unnatural capabilities. As time went on, terror struck the homeworld and displaced members of The Citadel sending them sprawling across the universe. Many were lost, but the ones who remain today refer to themselves as the Drifters. As centuries passed and numbers diminished, the whereabouts of the Citadel became unknown. Life since the displacement has made times tough for the Drifters, as reliance on the Citadel was key in their lives.

[ Why Join? ]
Not only is this group going to unite Drifters on the hunt for the Citadel, it will help form bonds between others in the Boxnaut Universe. Our faction is a place to prepare, train and socialize while trying to find our purpose in the cosmos. We look out for one another and make sure that the Drifters survive to find the Citadel. 

Members of The Drifters prioritize space exploration and observation technology above all others. With the constant struggles of a homeworld, leaps into advanced technology have been made by Drifters to ensure that no stone is left unturned.```
