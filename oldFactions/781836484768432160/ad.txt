**Our Purpose: ** 

We are a faction of protectors and explorers. We are against all bad and for all the factions in need! We do not hesitate to show any faction who declared war on us, that we are not just any normal faction! NO! We are an honourable faction with the goal of an ultimate fleet that protects and serves factions in need and not just with a normal faction member, but with Legends!  

 

**What benefits do you get? ** 

We’re a welcoming community and as the game releases we will stay together to gather resources, explore everything together, yes, even fight together! We still want to protect other players which we do together in a great, legendary unit. As the Lunarians!  

We are doing a Faction own Orientation and a Game Night every week!  

It's very fun every time! 

We are building the Division now and we are in search for some Commanders or just Members to join the Divisions! We need Medics, Soldiers, Craftsman, Scientists, Scouts and of course our Elite “The Nobility”.  

Become a Legend and follow the great and honourable path of the Lunarians! 

RISE AND SHINE TILL DEATH, LUNARIANS!
