     Crimson's Sushi Empire
█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█


Background:
Crimson's Sushi Empire is a Sushi company built on giving the inhabitance of the Boxnauts universe an enjoyable and luxury place to order food, work, or just generally enjoy themselves. Started in the planet known as Aquasis located in the Alpha Centauri region. Created by a fisherman who opened his own Sushi shop to help travelers who are passing by in the lands of Aquasis and providing a safe pitstop for the long journey ahead. Quickly expanding into a thriving metropolis of a diner.

Goal:
Crimson's Sushi Empire is a faction that strives to remain neutral in any future conflicts between other factions. Our sushi empire simply wishes to peacefully sell sushi and remain friendly with all other factions and to do this by running an import and export business of goods, while also creating a safe environment for players to work at a restaurant to safely earn  Materials, Items, and other incentives.
