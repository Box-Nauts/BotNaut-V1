Lore:
The Kingdom was one of the first factions to roam the Boxverse (quite literally), and has since then grown bigger. But the Kingdom had been even bigger then today, way larger then anyone would believe, but a mysterious plaque hit and people died, left and right. When the king realized that he wasn’t able to stop the disease, he and a few select buried themself deep underground in stasis chamber where they planned to wait out the disease. But something malfunctioned and the stasis chambers kept them asleep in millions of years, and when the stasis chamber ran out of battery, it launched itself back up to the surface where a confused king and his men woke up.

If you are looking for a faction that specializes in trading, is friendly and has a strong alliance, then join the kingdom. The Kingdom is a friendly trading faction that plans to discover the vast space of the boxverse and trade with both rare and common materials.
