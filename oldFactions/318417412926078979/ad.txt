*Lore:* Within the Boxnaut universe, lay the Imperium. A dominant faction that seeks to unify the Boxnaut universe together for a peaceful and prosperous tomorrow. Structured and inspired by the Sith Order from Star Wars and the Imperium Of Man from Warhammer 40k, the Imperium is a medium between the two offering a more structured experience opposed to other factions. The Imperium seeks out exploration, and has the ultimate goal of building an all powerful star fleet to traverse the stars, unified, and ready to face any challenges that present themselves. The Imperium does not seek conflict, but if other factions are foolish enough to declare war, then let there be bloodshed. Until such times, join the Imperium today and become not just a member, but a legend.
